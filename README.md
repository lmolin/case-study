# Knit & Crochet Project Manager

This application is a simple project and stash manager for knit and crochet projects, created for the Per Scholas Tek Pittsburgh Full-Stack Java developer program. Currently, it allows users to catalog current projects and yarn in their stash.

As an avid knitter, I frequently acquire new materials and pick up and drop projects on a whim. I decided to create a program that can help knitters catalog and prioritize their projects to work more efficiently.
